# Ph Mosaic Project

Photomus(a)ic is a university project developed and realized with p5.js library in Creative Coding class, taught by Michele Mauri and Andrea Benedetti at Politecnico di Milano.

## Introduction

Everyone loves music. You might listen to it a lot, or you might just let it play in the background when you really don't have anything else to do. Whichever you do, there's no doubt that you have an artist that you like more than everyone else. Every time he announces the release of a new album, you start to wonder what amazing new songs could be in it. You really can't wait for it to come out. And when that happens, you're happier than ever. You start to listen to the new songs over and over, from when you wake up to the moment you go to sleep. Unfortunately, there's a small drawback: once the album is out, you quickly forget all the emotions and all the suspense that you felt before the release. While you still enjoy the music - it's still your favourite artist - you're sad that all that thrill you previously felt is now gone.

## Project Idea

We thought that the reason you lose all the hype for the album release is that you never truly took part in it. You were just a spectator. We wanted to change that. The problem was: "What is the best way for you to be the protagonist of the release, while preserving the personality of the album?" In our opinion, the answer to this question lies in the album cover.
We thought that the best way to make the fans interact with the cover was to let them discover it bit by bit. In order to do that, we used a technique called photo mosaic: basically, you take an image and resize it, lowering its resolution. Then, you replace each of its pixels with other images, so that each of them has a brightness similar to the one of the corresponding pixel. In other words, you take a bunch of images and you rearrange them in a grid so that they recreate another image.

We created an app that will do exactly that: each user will be asked to take a picture. Then, our app will take all the pictures taken by the fans and rearrange them in order to recreate the cover. The users will be able to see the progress of the mosaic any time they want. When enough pictures will be uploaded, the cover will be completely formed, and the fans will be able to enjoy the image they managed to create.
